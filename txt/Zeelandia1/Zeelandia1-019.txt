central mountains, the hills of the South and the narrow plains of the East nearly one hun-
dred thousand descendants of the original inhabitants survive. Moreover, languages and
customs have little in common with those of the Formosans of the western plains with
whom the Dutch were in daily contact.

In some cases the Han-Chinese immigrants adopted the original toponyms and transla-
ted them into Chinese characters, so that they survive in a more or less corrupt form. In
most cases however the original names have been lost, and new Chinese names have been
given. As there are no detailed inland maps among the quite impressive collection of
Dutch 17th century coastal maps of Formosa, it often has been impossible to the editors
to retrace these place-names. Only prolonged research and continuous comparison of
newly acquired data will enable us to ascertain the geographical position of these settle-
ments.

Chinese place-names along the coast of mainland China also often are difficult to ascer-
tain as the contemporary Dutch observers did not dispose over an adequate transcription
system for noting down toponyms that were pronounced in southern Chinese dialects. The
editors fully realize that they may have occasionally been wrong in identifying place names
and therefore welcome any comment or additional information concerning the biographi-
cal or toponymical data. All information will be duly recorded and passed on to the rea-
ders in the following volumes. The present map drawn by professor Chiang Shu-sheng is
of a preliminary nature and we hope to include a more complete one in the last volume
of this series.
